MX Snapshot allows you to create a bootable ISO file of your currently running MX Linux installation.

Using MX Live USB Maker, you can write the ISO file to CD/DVD or USB to use as a recovery method or to install on other systems.

Two types of Snapshot ISO files can be created:
• “Personal Snapshot” - saves almost everything, used to backup current system, and personal files
• “System Snapshot” - with apps you installed and without ones you removed, and no personal files
