Using a new Operating System for the first time can seem challenging and scary.

MX Tour is designed to introduce and orient you to many of the features and graphical tools of MX Linux Fluxbox Edition (MXFB).

Each of the topic areas has been separated into Tabs on the far left.
You can use the Tabs by clicking them or use your keyboard Up and Down arrow keys.

We hope you find this tour useful!
