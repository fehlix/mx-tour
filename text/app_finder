The Application Finder (Applications Menu) is a easy to use and flexible main menu.

It consists of three main areas:
(1) Application Categories
(2) Search bar
(3) Individual Applications

You can open the Application Finder by Left-Clicking on the MX logo in the Panel or Quick Launch Dock.

When you first open it you are shown a list of all installed applications.
Additionally, you can browse through applications by clicking on the categories. 

If youâ€™re not sure exactly where a program is listed, the search field is automatically focused when opening the menu, so you can just search by application name or general words such as "browser".

To open an application, Double-Click on it or click the Launch button (4).

You can edit the menu behavior and appearance by clicking the Preferences (5) button.
