MX Tweak brings together many small but often used customizations organized under different Tabs.

Tabs Overview:
 • Panel - change the location and orientation of the panel, access the Docklike Taskbar properties
 • Theme - select a Theme Set and or individual Application, Window Manager, and Icon themes
 • Compositor - change commonly needed Window Manager Compositor options
 • Display - change Desktop scaling, monitor resolution, and brightness settings
 • Config Options - change Single-Click and Double-Click options and enable Desktop Zoom
 • Other - enable internal drive mount options, TearFree rendering, switch administrative account

Note: Some "tweaks" may not always appear, as they are desktop environment and hardware dependent.
