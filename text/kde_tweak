MX Tweak brings together some small but often used customizations organized under different Tabs.

Tabs Overview:
 • Plasma - change the location, orientation, and options of the panel
 • Other - enable internal drive mount options, TearFree rendering, switch administrative account

Note: Some "tweaks" may not always appear, as they are desktop environment and hardware dependent.
