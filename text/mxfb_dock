The Quick Launch Application Dock sits on the left side of the screen and by default provides easy access to a few commonly used applications.

It consists of:
(1) MX Tools
(2) MX Fluxbox User Manual
(3) MX Fluxbox Settings Manager
 
The default dock can easily be modified using MX Dockmaker; furthermore, it can be placed on auto-hide or cancelled completely using the root Menu > Out of Sight.

Another dock option is available using tint2 (the software behind the panel), which makes much greater customization possible. Two tint2 dock configurations can be found using the root Menu > Appearance > Dock.
