MX Tweak brings together many small customizations organized under different Tabs.

Tabs Overview:
 • Themes - select appearance elements: theme, MXFB style, icons and cursor; there is a separate app for Font
 • Fluxbox - set values for Dock, Menu, Desktop Icon, Toolbar and Thunar; Reset to defaults
 • Other - enable internal drive mount options, reset login screen, disable the All Apps menu, switch administrative account

Note: Some "tweaks" may not always appear, as they are desktop environment and hardware dependent.
