Using a new Operating System for the first time can seem challenging and scary.

MX Tour is designed to introduce and orient you to many of the features and graphical tools of MX Linux Xfce Edition.

Each of the topic areas have been separated into Tabs on the far left.

You can navigate these Tabs by clicking on them or using the Up and Down arrow keys on your keyboard.

We hope you find this tour useful!
