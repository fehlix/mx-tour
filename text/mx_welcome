When you booted your system for the first time, you should have noticed a Welcome screen that appeared in the center of the screen that offers quick orientation and help links for new and veteran users.

You can access MX Welcome again by finding it in the main Main Application Menu or by opening MX Tools.

You can use the 'Show this dialog at start up' checkbox (as shown above) if you would like to see MX Welcome each time your system starts and uncheck it when you no longer need it.
