You've probably noticed that the default desktop of MX Linux has a single vertical panel on the left side of the screen.  

This may be very different to what you are used to, but it saves screen space for your applications, and it can become very natural after a short amount of time.

Panel orientation is easily changeable in MX Tools > MX Tweak.

Even more options to customize your panel exist under Settings Manager > Panel

Lets explore some of the key components of the panel from top to bottom:

(1) Power Button which opens a window to:
    • Log Out
    • Restart
    • Shutdown
    • Suspend

(2) Clock (Date Time)
    • Left-Click to open a calendar
    • Right-Click to change the properties

(3) Docklike Taskbar (Application Switcher)
    • Firefox browser
    • Thunar File Manager

(4) Notification Area consists of (from top to bottom)
    • Volume manager
    • USB ejector
    • Clipboard manager
    • Network manager
    • Update manager
    • Power manager
